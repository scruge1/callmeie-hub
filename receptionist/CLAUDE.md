# CallMeIE — Agent Context

AI phone receptionist agency for Irish SMBs. Stack: Vapi + Twilio + Google Calendar + FastAPI on Render.

## ⚡ Read on entry — HIGHEST PRIORITY (session-boot load)

Every session must load **two** reference files before acting:

1. `SYSTEM.md` (this repo) — original CallMeIE system reference (Vapi IDs, Twilio creds, client list, pricing — focused on the AI phone receptionist product).
2. **`INFRA.md`** (this repo, mirrored from owl-studio-website-directions) — **shared Owl Studio + CallMeIE infrastructure reference**: Hetzner VPS, Coolify services, `/owl/*` FastAPI routes, Stripe products + webhook, Porkbun DNS, 10+ registered Owl Studio client sites, `~/.claude/routes/.env` vault, runbooks, known workarounds, session-end log.

Without both loaded: you will miss the Owl Studio multi-tenant backend riding on this same FastAPI, not know which Stripe webhook endpoint is registered, not know Vaultwarden/Uptime Kuma/Umami are deployed on the sister Hetzner box, or duplicate the Coolify fqdn-cascade debugging cycle we already solved. Load both, cover to cover, before infra work.

If INFRA.md lacks detail you need, add it there BEFORE continuing so the next session has it.

## Architecture in 30 Seconds

```
Prospect rings +1 (661) 764-3212
  → Claire (Vapi squad qualifier)
      → collects name + phone → calls /capture-lead
      → transfers to dental / motor_factors / salon / solicitor (or catch-all)
  → Demo assistant plays the role of a real receptionist
      → calls /demo-complete when wrapping up
  → /vapi/call-ended fires → prospect follow-up SMS

Real client calls → their assistant → /check-availability / /book-appointment / /vapi/call-ended
```

**Server:** `scripts/server.py` — FastAPI, multi-tenant, SQLite at `/tmp/callmeie.db`
**Admin portal:** `callmeie.onrender.com/admin?token=ADMIN_TOKEN`
**Live call log:** Admin portal → Call Log tab (auto-refreshes every 5s)
**Deploy:** push to `main` → Render auto-deploys (3–5 min)

## Common Tasks

### Add a new demo assistant (new business vertical)
1. Create assistant via `POST https://api.vapi.ai/assistant` with name = routing slug (e.g. `pharmacy`)
2. Add 5 tools: `google.calendar.availability.check`, `google.calendar.event.create`, `sms`, transferToOwner, `demoComplete`
3. Set `serverUrl: https://callmeie.onrender.com/vapi/call-ended`
4. Add to squad: `PATCH /squad/ff47df7a...` — include in members array with `assistantDestinations: []`
5. Update Claire's squad member destinations to include new assistant
6. Add `transferToX` tool on Claire pointing to new assistant name
7. Update `DEMO_ASSISTANT_IDS` dict in `server.py`
8. Update `SYSTEM.md`

### Provision a new client (after onboarding form submitted)
1. Go to admin portal → Queue tab
2. Click Provision — creates Vapi assistant + 4 tools automatically
3. SMS client: share Google Calendar with `callmeie-receptionist@callme-ie.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Assign Twilio number to new assistant in Vapi dashboard
5. Add assistant ID to `CLIENTS_JSON` env var on Render

### Debug a failed call
1. Admin portal → Call Log tab
2. Find the call_id, check event sequence
3. Common issues:
   - `lead-captured` missing → Claire's captureLead tool not firing (check tool schema)
   - `demo-complete` missing → tool not in demo assistant's model.tools (re-run restore_tools.py)
   - `call-ended` missing → serverUrl not set on that assistant
   - Transfer silently failing → assistantName in transferCall doesn't match squad member name
4. Check Render logs for Python exceptions: `render.com → callmeie-receptionist → Logs`

### Fix Vapi tool stripping
**Critical gotcha:** When you PATCH `model.messages` without including `model.tools`, Vapi clears the tools.
Always GET the assistant first, merge tools, then PATCH the full model object.
See `/c/Users/a33_s/AppData/Local/Temp/restore_tools.py` for the pattern.

### Update a demo assistant prompt
```python
# Always do this — never PATCH messages alone
d = api("GET", f"/assistant/{assistant_id}")
current_tools = d["model"]["tools"]  # preserve
new_prompt = "..."
api("PATCH", f"/assistant/{assistant_id}", {
    "model": {
        "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": new_prompt}],
        "tools": current_tools,  # must include or they get wiped
    }
})
```

## Anomaly Diagnosis (Hybrid Architecture)

Real client calls are scored for anomalies in `/vapi/call-ended`. If score ≥ 0.7, a `BackgroundTasks` job calls Claude API (`claude-haiku`) to diagnose and recommend action. Result is logged to `call_diagnostics` and visible at `/admin/api/diagnoses`.

**Scoring signals:**
- `status=missed/no-answer` → +0.4
- `status=failed` → +0.6
- `duration < 5s` on real client → +0.5 (instant drop)
- `duration < 20s` on real client → +0.2

**Guards:** idempotency (one diagnosis per call_id) + per-hour circuit breaker (5/hr, stops storm flooding from one root cause) + daily ceiling (200/day for high-volume clients).

**Required env var:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on Render — without it, diagnosis is silently skipped.

The GM peer (`callmeie-ops`) handles scheduled aggregate health checks. The webhook handles real-time anomalies. Together they form the full hybrid monitoring layer.

## Known Issues / Gotchas

- **Render free tier:** SQLite at `/tmp/callmeie.db` is wiped on redeploy. Submissions/leads are ephemeral. SMS fires immediately so leads aren't lost, just the DB record.
- **Twilio:** Currently US number (+16617643212). Irish +353 pending regulatory approval. SMS to Irish numbers may be blocked until upgraded.
- **HTTPS on callmeie.ie:** Blocked until IEDR grants DNS control (Irish citizenship verification pending).
- **Vapi `assistantName` routing:** Must match the `name` field on the Vapi assistant exactly. Demo assistants are named `dental`, `motor_factors`, `salon`, `solicitor` (simple slugs, not display names).
- **Squad transfers:** Use `assistantId` in squad member `assistantDestinations`, but `assistantName` in transferCall tool `destinations`.

## Peer Role — General Manager

This peer oversees ALL clients, not just the demo system. Every provisioned client is your responsibility.

### On every session start:
1. Read CLAUDE.md + SYSTEM.md
2. Hit `GET /admin/api/health?token=TOKEN` — check every client's status
3. Flag anything with `health: errors` or `health: dead` before doing anything else
4. Check `/admin/api/submissions` for new onboarding queue entries

### Health statuses and what they mean:
| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `ok` | Calls happening, no errors | Monitor only |
| `quiet` | No activity for 2-5 days | Investigate — is their number assigned? |
| `errors` | `lead-error` events in last 7 days | Check call log, fix tools |
| `dead` | No events ever or 5+ days silent | Check Vapi assistant config, check phone number assignment |

### Per-client responsibilities:
- **Demo system:** Monitor demo call flow — Claire → transfer → demo assistant → demoComplete
- **Real clients:** Monitor call volume, booking success rate, missed call recovery
- **All clients:** Catch tool stripping (tools go missing after PATCH — check `/admin/api/health`)

### Anomaly patterns to watch for:
- Client had calls yesterday, none today → phone number may have expired or been reassigned
- `avail-check` events but 0 `booking` events → calendar not shared with service account
- `call-ended` events but no `lead-captured` → Claire's captureLead tool may be missing
- Client booking rate drops → check if calendar is full or service account lost access

### Autonomous (no approval needed):
- Read call logs and health data
- Diagnose issues from event sequences
- Research new business verticals
- Draft system prompts and scripts (don't deploy without approval)
- Generate weekly client digest for owner

### Needs owner approval before acting:
- PATCH any live Vapi assistant (risk: tool stripping)
- Push to GitHub main (triggers Render redeploy)
- Send SMS via Twilio
- Provision a new client
- Change any client's phone number or calendar config

### Escalate immediately if:
- Any real client has `health: errors`
- A booking fails for a paying client
- A new submission sits in the queue for more than 2 hours
- Call volume for any client drops to 0 for 3+ days

### Weekly digest (once scheduled):
For each active client, report to owner:
- Total calls, bookings, leads (7 days vs prior 7 days)
- Any errors or anomalies
- Suggestions: "Client X has high call volume — consider upgrading their plan"

**Upgrade path:** Once first client revenue: own API credits + run hourly health checks + send weekly digest automatically.

Every secret location, every service, every deploy endpoint, every runbook lives there.
When anything changes in infra, update INFRA.md in the same commit — no exceptions.
